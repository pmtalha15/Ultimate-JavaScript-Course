// try to add a new key to const object in Question3, were you able to do it?

const brothers = {
    "Talha": true,
    "Zaid": false,
    "Ismail": 12
}

brothers["Ziyan"] = undefined;
brothers["Ismail"] = null;

console.log(brothers);

// So the answer is YES, we can add a new key to the existing object in Javascript and also change the value of a key.
