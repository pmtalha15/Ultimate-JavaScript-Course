// Create a const object in javascript. can you change it to hold a number later?

const item = {
    "Talha": true,
    "Zaid": false,
    "Ismail": 12
}

item = 24; // this will throw an error as a const variable cannot be updated or redeclared

// So the answer to the question will be NO, you cannot change the it to hold a number.
